And the reason I wrote that post is because I kept, I kind of saw something remarkable happening in like software development and how a lot of code was being transitioned to be written not in sort of like C++ and so on, but it&#x27;s written in the weights of a neural net. Basically just saying that neural nets are taken over software, the realm of software and taking more and more and more tasks. And at the time, I think not many...","like that and directly programming the software. It&#x27;s going to be accumulating training sets and data sets and crafting these objectives by which you train these neural nets. And at some point, there&#x27;s going to be a compilation process from the datasets and the objective and the architecture specification into the binary, which is really just the neural net weights and the forward pass of the neural net. And then you can deploy that binary. And so I was talking about that sort of transition and ...","they were like really going at it. They were like thinking about how they&#x27;re going to write the algorithm. And this is not the way you build it. And there was a smooth transition where, okay, first we thought we were going to build everything. Then we were building the features, so like hog features and things like that that detect these little statistical patterns from image patches. And then there was a little bit of learning on top of it, like a support vector machine or binary classifier for...","tons of filling blanks, which is all the knobs. And you let the optimization write most of it. And so this transition is happening across the industry everywhere. And suddenly we end up with a ton of code that is written in neural net weights. And I was just pointing out that the analogy is actually pretty strong. And we have a lot of developer environments for software 1.0, like we have IDEs, how you work with code, how you debug code, how you run code, how do you maintain code, we have GitHub....","been coming around to it over time. Yeah. So you were the director of AI at Tesla, where I think this idea was really implemented at scale, which is how you have engineering teams doing software 2.0. So can you sort of linger on that idea of I think we&#x27;re in the really early stages of everything you just said, which is like GitHub IDEs, like how do we build engineering teams that that work in software 2.0 systems and the data collection and the data annotation, which is all part of that software...","data sets and the architecture of the neural net. And so in the case of the autopilot, a lot of the data sets had to do with, for example, detection of objects and lane line markings and traffic lights and so on.

And then here&#x27;s roughly what the algorithm should look like, and that&#x27;s a completion on your own net. So the specification of the architecture is like a hint as to what the algorithm should roughly look...","down a problem into a set of tasks. Yeah. I&#x27;m going to high level, I would say, if you look at the software running in the autopilot, I give a number of talks on this topic. I would say originally a lot of it was written in software 1.0. There was, imagine lots of C++, right? And then gradually there was a tiny neural net that was, for example, predicting given a single image, is there like a traffic light or not, or is there a lane line marking or not? And this neural net didn&#x27;t have too much t...","And then we decided, okay, we don&#x27;t actually want to do all of that fusion in C++ code because we&#x27;re actually not good enough to write that algorithm. We want the neural net to write the algorithm. And we want to port all of that software into the 2.0 stack.

So, and actually they don&#x27;t make predictions in the space of images. They now make predictions directly in ...","sort of goal is to have most of the software potentially be in the 2.0 land because it works significantly better. Humans are just not very good at writing software, basically. So the prediction is happening in this like 4D land with three dimensional world over time. How do you do annotation in that world?

I would say by far in the industry, if you&#x27;re like talking about the industry and...","you can. And the more you can cover the space of possible inputs, the better the algorithm will work at the end. Now, once you have really good data sets that you&#x27;re collecting, curating, and cleaning, you can train your neural net on top of that. So a lot of the work goes into cleaning those data sets.

You can also go for what we call the offline tracker that we spoken about at the AI day and so on, which is basically an automatic reconstruction process for taking ...","It&#x27;s difficult. But it can be done. So there&#x27;s the overlap between the cameras and you do the reconstruction. And there&#x27;s perhaps there&#x27;s any inaccuracy. So that&#x27;s caught in the annotation step. Yes, the nice thing about the annotation is that it is fully offline. You have infinite time. You have a chunk of one minute and you&#x27;re trying to just offline in a supercomputer somewhere, figure out where were the positions of all the cars, all the people.

That was really interesting....","very, very hard.

Beginners are often focused on like what to do. And I think the focus should be more like how much you do. So I am kind of like believer on a high level in this 10,0...","like there&#x27;s some sense of the feminism about being an expert at a thing if you spend 10,000 hours. You can literally pick an arbitrary thing. And I think if you spend 10,000 hours of deliberate effort and work, you actually will become an expert at it. And so I think it&#x27;s kind of like a nice thought. And so basically I would focus more on like are you spending 10,000 hours? And I focus on. So and then thinking about what kind of mechanisms maximize your likelihood of getting to 10,000 hours? Ex...","ago. Are you better than you year ago? This is the only way to think. And I think this then you can see your progress and it&#x27;s very motivating. That&#x27;s so interesting that focus on the quantity of hours. Because I think a lot of people in the beginner stage, but I actually throughout get paralyzed by the choice. Like which one do I pick this path or this path? Yeah. Like they&#x27;ll literally get paralyzed by like which IDE to use. Well, they&#x27;re worried. Yeah, they&#x27;ll worry about all these things. Bu...","scar tissue and I have some intuitions about what was useful, what wasn&#x27;t useful, how things turned out. So all those mistakes were not dead work. So I just think, did you just focus on working? What have you done? What have you done last week? That&#x27;s a good question actually to ask for a lot of things that just machine learning.

And teaching itself is not like the most, I mean, it&#x27;s really, it can be really annoying frustrating. I was working on a bunch of lectures just now. I was reminded back to my days of 231 and just how much work it is to create some of these materials and make them good. The amount of iteration and thought and you go down blind alleys and just how much you change it. So creating something good in terms of like educational alleys is really hard. And it&#x27;s not fun. It was difficult. So fo...","and then I take like the the better take. So I do multiple takes and I take some of the better takes and then I just build out a lecture that way. Sometimes I have to delete 30 minutes of content because it just went down the alley that I didn&#x27;t like too much. So there&#x27;s a bunch of iteration and it probably takes me you know somewhere around 10 hours to create one hour of content to give one hour. It&#x27;s interesting. I mean, is it difficult to go back to the like the basics? Do you draw a lot of l...","look at this. And then the result doesn&#x27;t look like it. And I&#x27;m like, okay, I thought I understood this. Yeah. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s really cool to literally code. You run it in a notebook and it gives you a result and you&#x27;re like, oh, wow. And like actual numbers, actual input, actual, actual code. Yeah, it&#x27;s not mathematical symbols, etc. The source of truth is the code. It&#x27;s not slides. It&#x27;s just like, let&#x27;s build it. It&#x27;s beautiful. You&#x27;re a rare human in that sense. What advice would you give to ...","make progress. And now you have to work in like LHC or like CERN. And so AI is going in that direction as well. So there&#x27;s certain kinds of things that&#x27;s just not possible to do on the bench stop anymore.

Yeah, what do you find most fascinating about diffusion models? So from the societal impact of the technical architecture, what I like about the fusion is it works so well.

It&#x27;s the speed of improvement in generating images has been insane. W...","So it doesn&#x27;t materialize the attention matrix. And so there&#x27;s, I think there&#x27;s still like lots of things to contribute, but you have to be just more strategic. Do you think neural networks can be made to reason? Yes. Do you think they already reason? Yes. What&#x27;s your definition of reasoning? Information processing. So in the way the humans think through a problem and come up with novel ideas, it feels like reasoning. Yeah. So the novelty, I don&#x27;t want to say, but out of distribution ideas, you ...","thinking. To me, thinking or reasoning is just information processing and generalization.

I think, as I mentioned, I&#x27;m suspicious that text realm is not enough to actually build full understanding of the world. I do actually think you need to go into pixels and understand the physical world and how it works. So I do think that we need to extend these models to consume images and videos and train on a lot more data that is multimodal in that way. Do you think you need to touch the world to understand it also? Well, that&#x27;s the big ...","to me, there&#x27;s nothing beyond Optimus. You have this humanoid form factor that can actually do stuff in the world. You kind of millions of them interacting with humans and so on. And if that doesn&#x27;t give a rise to AGI, at some point, I&#x27;m not sure what will. So from a completeness perspective, I think that&#x27;s the really good platform, but it&#x27;s a much harder platform because you are dealing with atoms and you need to actually build these things and integrate them into society. So I think that path ...","it might, that results in happening faster. So it just feels like we&#x27;re in boiling water. We won&#x27;t know as it&#x27;s happening. I would like to, I&#x27;m not afraid of AGI. I&#x27;m excited about it. There&#x27;s always concerns, but I would like to know when it happens. Yeah. And have like hints about when it happens. Like a year from now, it will happen, that kind of thing. I just feel like in the digital realm, it just might happen. Yeah. I think all we have available to us because no one has built AGI again.

You will, you will figure out and ...","to interact with humans and other living beings, consciousness is a very useful tool. I think consciousness is like a modeling insight. Modeling insight. Yeah, it&#x27;s a, you have a powerful enough model of understanding the world, but you actually understand that you are an entity in it. Yeah, but there&#x27;s also this, perhaps just a narrative we tell ourselves, there&#x27;s a, it feels like something to experience the world, the hard problem of consciousness. Yeah. But that could be just a narrative that...","you&#x27;re allowed to turn off a conscious AI, if you&#x27;re allowed to build the conscious AI, maybe there would have to be the same kind of the base that you have around, sorry, to bring up a political topic, but a portion, which is the deeper question with abortion is what is life?

Just as genes compete and live in biological organisms, ideas (referred to as memes) compete and live in our brains. The conversation suggests that ideas evolve and propagate in a manner similar to genes.","The data engine in the context of neural networks is described as an almost biological feeling-like process by which you perfect the training sets for these neural networks. It involves making sure that the data sets are large, diverse, and clean, and it includes the entire pipeline from training the neural nets to evaluating and iterating on the system. It is crucial for optimizing the neural networks to fit within the constraints of the system, such as memory bandwidth and computational limits.","Vision is important for self-driving technology because the world is designed for human visual consumption, making vision both necessary and sufficient for driving. Vision provides all the information needed for driving, as humans primarily use their vision to drive. Additionally, cameras are very cheap and provide a vast amount of information, making them an efficient sensor for capturing the state of the world.","The agent thinks that Goddo is interesting and represents a \\"kitchen sink\\" approach to reinforcement learning, integrating various environments with a single fixed transformer model. They consider it an early result in its realm, reflecting the direction in which things might eventually evolve. They would prefer if all interfaces were normalized into the same API.","In the context of image classification, programming the software involves several key steps centered around the use of training sets, data sets, and neural networks. Here is the sequence of steps:\\n\\n1. **Accumulate Training Sets and Data Sets**: The first step is to gather a large collection of images (data sets) that are labeled with the correct categories (training sets). For instance, if the task is to classify images of dogs, the data set would consist of many images of dogs, each labeled as such.\\n\\n2. **Craft Objectives**: Define the objectives that the neural network needs to achieve. These objectives guide the learning process of the neural network.\\n\\n3. **Specify the Architecture**: Design the architecture of the neural network. This involves deciding on the structure of the neural net, including the number of layers, the types of layers (convolutional, pooling, fully connected, etc.), and how they are connected.\\n\\n4. **Compilation Process**: Compile the data sets, objectives, and architecture specifications into a form that can be used to train the neural network. This involves converting the high-level specifications into a format that can be processed by the training algorithm.\\n\\n5. **Training Process**: Train the neural network using the compiled data sets and objectives. This involves feeding the training images into the neural network, allowing it to adjust its weights through optimization techniques like backpropagation, so that it learns to classify images correctly.\\n\\n6. **Optimization**: Fine-tune the neural network by adjusting its parameters to improve its performance on the training set. This step aims to minimize the error in predictions and improve the accuracy of the neural network.\\n\\n7. **Deployment**: Once the neural network is trained and optimized, it can be deployed. The final product is essentially a binary that contains the neural net weights and the forward pass mechanism, which can then be used to classify new images.\\n\\nOverall, the sequence involves a transition from manually programming algorithms to a more automated process where the neural network learns from data sets through training and optimization.","The speaker would opt for an Earth-like planet that has the conditions based on their understanding of the chemistry prerequisites for life. Subsequently, they would seed it with life, run the experiment, observe it, and protect it.","The literary works mentioned that significantly influenced the speaker&#x27;s perspectives are:\\n\\n1. \\"The Vital Question\\" by Nick Lane\\n2. \\"Life Ascending\\" by Nick Lane\\n3. \\"The Selfish Gene\\" by Richard Dawkins","The fundamental approach utilized to train the GPD language model involves downloading a massive amount of text data from the internet and using it to predict the next word in a sequence. This process is roughly described as predicting little work chunks, but the core idea is to predict the next word based on the context provided by the preceding words. By training on such a vast dataset, the model is able to develop a deep understanding of language patterns and context. This method enables the model to perform various tasks by completing sentences based on the input it receives.","I don&#x27;t know.","In the context of AI systems, the concept of evolution initializing our learning process can be likened to the initial setup and optimization of AI models. Just as evolution has equipped humans with innate abilities and hardware that assist in learning and adaptation, AI systems require a foundational setup, which includes the integration of diverse and relevant data, as well as the selection and fine-tuning of sensors and other input mechanisms.\\n\\nFor AI systems, this foundational setup involves:\\n\\n1. **Data Collection**: Ensuring that the AI system has access to a diverse and comprehensive dataset. This is akin to the evolutionary process where organisms are equipped with innate abilities to interact with their environment. In AI, engineers must collect data that accurately represents the scenarios the AI will encounter.\\n\\n2. **Sensor Integration**: Just as humans have various sensory inputs (sight, sound, touch, etc.) that help them learn and adapt, AI systems require the integration of appropriate sensors to gather inputs from the environment. These sensors must be well-calibrated and capable of capturing the necessary data for the AI to function effectively.\\n\\n3. **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Similar to how biological systems have optimized their functions over time through evolution, AI systems require careful tuning of hyperparameters to ensure optimal performance. This involves iterative testing and adjustment to enhance the system&#x27;s learning efficiency and accuracy.\\n\\n4. **Engineering Execution**: The successful implementation of AI systems relies heavily on the expertise and execution of the engineering team. They must understand the underlying principles of data collection, sensor integration, and system optimization to build a robust AI model.\\n\\nBy drawing parallels between evolutionary processes and AI system development, we can appreciate the importance of initial setup, data diversity, sensor integration, and continuous optimization in creating effective and adaptive AI systems.","The most challenging aspects of the vision problem in autonomous driving include processing information from a powerful sensor and converting that information into an understanding of the three-dimensional world. This involves going from the brightness values captured by the sensors to a three-dimensional interpretation of the environment. Additionally, the difficulty lies in engineering the entire pipeline extremely well to handle this complex task.","Tesla&#x27;s choice to use Google map-like resolution information instead of pre-mapping environments to centimeter-level accuracy for navigation is driven by several key considerations:\\n\\n1. **Focus on Computer Vision**: The company believes that the primary challenge in achieving autonomous driving is solving the computer vision problem. By focusing on real-time perception and decision-making using camera data, Tesla aims to develop a robust system that can navigate dynamically changing environments without relying on pre-mapped data.\\n\\n2. **Cost and Efficiency**: Pre-mapping environments to centimeter-level accuracy is seen as a costly and resource-intensive approach. Maintaining and continuously updating such high-resolution maps for expansive geographic areas would require significant ongoing investment and effort, diverting resources away from core technological development.\\n\\n3. **Scalability**: Tesla is aiming for a global deployment of its autonomous systems. Relying on centimeter-accurate maps for vast regions would create a massive dependency and potentially hinder scalability. The approach of using lower-resolution maps that provide general road connectivity information is deemed more scalable and practical for widespread adoption.\\n\\n4. **Human Analogy**: Humans do not rely on centimeter-level accurate maps to navigate. Instead, they use general knowledge and real-time perception to move through environments. By emulating this approach, Tesla&#x27;s system aims to be more adaptive and resilient to changes in the driving environment.\\n\\nOverall, Tesla&#x27;s approach emphasizes the importance of real-time perception and decision-making over extensive pre-mapped data, aligning with their goal of creating scalable and efficient autonomous driving technology.","The speaker suggests two pathways towards accomplishing AGI:\\n\\n1. **Humanoid robots (Optimus)**: Creating a humanoid form factor that can interact with humans and perform tasks in the physical world. This pathway is considered more certain but requires dealing with physical atoms and integrating these robots into society, which is a harder and longer process.\\n\\n2. **Internet-based models**: Training compression models on the internet to effectively compress and interact with the digital world. This pathway does not require entering the physical world and might result in achieving AGI faster, although it is considered more concerning.","Humans excel at two-dimensional annotations of images.","Samuel Carlin is credited with saying \\"The purpose of models is not to fit the data, but to sharpen the questions.\\"","I don&#x27;t know.","I don&#x27;t know.","I don&#x27;t know.","The transformer architecture, used by Tesla AI, is successful due to several key design criteria:\\n\\n1. **Expressive Forward Pass**: The transformer is capable of expressing very general computation in its forward pass. This allows it to handle a wide range of tasks, from next-word prediction to image recognition, making it a versatile tool in various AI applications.\\n\\n2. **Optimizable Weights**: The architecture is designed to be optimizable via backpropagation and gradient descent, which are standard and efficient optimization techniques. This includes the use of residual connections, layer normalizations, and attention mechanisms, which facilitate smooth and effective training.\\n\\n3. **Efficient High Parallelism Compute Graph**: Transformers are designed to run efficiently on modern hardware, particularly GPUs, which are optimized for parallel processing. The architecture minimizes sequential operations and maximizes parallel ones, thereby taking full advantage of the massive throughput capabilities of GPUs.\\n\\nThese criteria collectively make the transformer architecture both powerful and efficient, contributing significantly to its widespread success and adoption in various AI applications, including those by Tesla.","The process of creating educational content involves significant iteration and effort. It includes:\\n\\n1. Developing lectures and materials, which requires a lot of time and thought.\\n2. Going through multiple takes to select the best one.\\n3. Deleting content that does not meet the desired quality or direction.\\n4. Spending approximately 10 hours to create one hour of content.\\n\\nThe benefits of teaching include:\\n\\n1. Strengthening the teacher&#x27;s own understanding of the material.\\n2. Revealing gaps in the teacher&#x27;s knowledge, which can then be addressed.\\n3. Providing a powerful way to learn through the necessity of explaining concepts clearly to others.\\n\\nOverall, while creating educational content is time-consuming and challenging, it also offers significant benefits in terms of personal learning and understanding.","The hope for the transition to AI is that it will happen slowly and openly enough for a large number of people to observe and participate in managing the transition. The inspiration drawn from nuclear weapons is that, despite their initial development being seen as potentially catastrophic, humanity learned how to manage and regulate their use. Similarly, the idea is that even if AI systems are initially deployed and found to be dangerous, humans are clever and capable of quickly learning how to avoid using them in harmful ways, thereby achieving a balance.","I don&#x27;t know.","Large neural nets, such as GPTs, can perform a variety of tasks like sentiment analysis, translation, and other language-related tasks by being prompted with very few examples. They work by being pre-trained on massive datasets, which enables them to understand the context of the input data. They can complete tasks efficiently by leveraging the patterns and knowledge encoded during the pre-training phase. For instance, they can complete a translation task by being given a few examples and then predicting the continuation or translation of an input sentence. This process utilizes the activations of the neural net rather than the weights, showcasing their data efficiency and emerging properties like in-context learning.","Current models in relation to search engines have the capability to directly provide answers with supporting evidence by distilling knowledge from a vast amount of texts and web pages. This reduces the need for users to sift through search results to get an average answer to their queries. Prompting is viewed as a kind of teaching and learning process, potentially adding another layer to how humans interact and learn from these models.","The transition of responsibilities involved moving from a more hands-on technical role to a managerial position. Initially, the person was involved in building and training deep neural networks for Tesla&#x27;s computer vision system, which was at the time transitioning from using a third-party vendor (Mobileye) to developing its own system. Over the five years, their role evolved into attending meetings, growing the organization, and making high-level strategic decisions about the team and its projects, which resembled a corporate executive role. This shift from technical work to managerial duties led to their decision to leave Tesla, as the managerial role was not fundamentally what they enjoyed.","I don&#x27;t know.","I don&#x27;t know.","I don&#x27;t know.","I don&#x27;t know."]],["reference_answer",["Simulation is not seen as a fundamental, really important part of training neural nets currently. However, as neural nets become more powerful, fewer examples might be needed to train additional behaviors. Even though there&#x27;s a domain gap in simulation that is not the real world, with a powerful neural net, the domain gap can be bigger because the neural net will understand that even though it&#x27;s not the real world.","The comparison made between genes and ideas is that there is an evolutionary process with ideas just like with genes. These ideas, or &#x27;memes&#x27;, compete and live in our brains, similar to how genes function.","The data engine is the process by which you perfect the training sets for these neural networks. Most of the programming now is in the level of these data sets and making sure they&#x27;re large, diverse, and clean.","Vision is necessary for self-driving technology because the world is designed for human visual consumption. It&#x27;s also sufficient because it has all the information needed for driving. Humans use vision to drive, so it&#x27;s both necessary and sufficient for self-driving technology.","The agent finds Goddo interesting as it is a kitchen sink approach to reinforcement learning with lots of different environments using a single fixed transformer model. However, the agent is not a fan of interfaces that look very different and would prefer everything to be normalized into the same API.","The process involves accumulating training sets and data sets, crafting objectives to train neural nets, and then there&#x27;s a compilation process from the datasets, the objective, and the architecture specification into the binary, which is really just the neural net weights and the forward pass of the neural net. This binary can then be deployed.","The speaker would choose an earth-like planet that has the conditions based on their understanding of the chemistry prerequisites for life. They would seed it with life and run it as a scientific experiment.","The books that had an impact on the speaker include &#x27;The Vital Question&#x27; by Nick Lane, &#x27;Life Ascending&#x27; by the same author, and &#x27;The Selfish Gene&#x27;.","The GPD language model is trained by downloading a massive amount of text data from the internet and trying to predict the next word in a sequence.","The internet has a huge amount of data, but it might not be a complete enough set. Text, audio, video, and images are available, but there are many things about how the world works that we don&#x27;t put in text because they are obvious to us. Therefore, text from the internet alone may not be sufficient for creating a powerful AGI.","Evolution plays a significant role in our learning process by providing us with a lot of hardware that helps initialize our learning. This is evident in animals like Zebras who, upon birth, can see and run without any trained data in their lifespan. This suggests that evolution has found a way to encode these abilities.","The toughest parts of the vision problem of driving are processing the information from the extremely powerful sensor and going from brightnesses of these special values to understanding the three-dimensional world. This is what the neural networks are fundamentally doing.","Tesla uses Google map-like resolution information in its system. However, it does not pre-map environments to centimeter-level accuracy. The focus is on solving the computer vision problem, not on creating highly detailed maps.","The two paths to AGI according to the speaker are through physical entities like Optimus, which interact with humans and the world, and through the internet by training compression models to compress and interact with the internet. The speaker believes that AGI can be achieved without ever entering the physical world.","Humans are very good at two-dimensional annotations of images.","Samuel Carlin is credited with saying &#x27;The purpose of models is not to fit the data, but to sharpen the questions&#x27;.","The speaker is against destroying complex dynamical systems. They believe these systems are amazing, interesting, and special, having taken a long time to evolve. The speaker expresses a desire to preserve such systems if possible.","Tesla is a bursty environment. The baseline is higher than Google but there&#x27;s a punctually equilibrium where once in a while there&#x27;s a fire and people work really hard.

However, they are not sure if this will happen in their lifetime.","The transformer architecture is successful due to a number of design criteria. It is expressive in the forward pass, meaning it can express lots of different types of algorithms. It is also optimizable, which is crucial as many powerful computers are not easy to optimize using the techniques that we have, such as backpropagation and gradient descent. Lastly, the transformer is designed to run efficiently on our hardware, like GPUs, which prefer lots of parallelism.","The process of creating educational content involves multiple takes, iteration, and sometimes deleting content that went down an unwanted path. It can take around 10 hours to create one hour of content. The benefits of teaching include strengthening your understanding of the subject, identifying gaps in knowledge, and it is also a way to learn.","The hope for the transition to AI is that it happens slowly enough and in an open enough way where a lot of people can see and participate in it. The inspiration drawn from nuclear weapons in this context is that even though they are dangerous, humans have learned not to use them, hoping a similar balance will be achieved with AI.","One example that&#x27;s been very influential recently is diffusion models, they&#x27;re an amazing generative model, especially in images.","Large neural nets like GPTs, when trained on complicated problems, take on surprising emergent behaviors such as next word prediction in a massive data set from the internet. GPTs are essentially next word prediction networks that consume a sequence of words and try to predict the next word. Once trained on a large enough data set, they can be prompted in arbitrary ways to solve problems based on what they&#x27;ve seen on the internet.","These models have read all the texts and all the web pages, and can directly provide answers with supporting evidence, distilling all that knowledge into some level of insight. Prompting, on the other hand, can be seen as another layer in the teaching and learning process.","When the director of AI first joined Tesla, he was writing code. As time went on, he wrote less code and began reading more code.
