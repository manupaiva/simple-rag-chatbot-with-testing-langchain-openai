It is expressive in the forward pass, meaning it can express lots of different types of algorithms.

Not only that, but the weights designed with the residual connections, lane normalizations, the softmatics, attention and everything. It's also optimizable. This is a really big deal because there's lots of computers. There are powerful that you can't optimize. Or they are not easy to optimize using the techniques that we have, which is backpropocation and gradient descent. These are our first order methods, very simple optimizers, really. And so you also needed to be optimizable. And then lastly, you wanted to run efficiently in our hardware. Our hardware is a massive throughput machine, like GPUs. They prefer lots of parallelism. So you don't want to do lots of sequential operations. You want to do a lot of operations seriously. And the transformer is designed with that in mind as well.

You want to have a general purpose computer that you can train on arbitrary problems. Like say the task of next work prediction or detecting if there's a cat in a image or something like that.
